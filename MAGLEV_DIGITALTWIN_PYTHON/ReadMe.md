# How To Use
## Running the Simulation
Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` followed by ```python topSimulate.py```. Or, if your environment is already set up, just run the python file.
## Modifying the PID control algorithm
Modify ```controller.py```. You will see constants related to heave, pitch, and roll controllers. Will update to include current control and will make simulation much more accurate soon.
## Modifying pod parameters
```parameters.py``` provides all necessary mechanical parameters. Yoke and sensor locations are matrices formed by putting together 4 column vectors of the form $\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$ relative to the center of mass. <br><br>```fmag2()``` within ```utils.py``` deals with the magnetic parameters.
